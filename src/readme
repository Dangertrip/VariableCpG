A.
haplotype.py:  generate haplotype for every read
python haplotype.py cpgfile bamfile

B.
(Optional: if samples are pairend) python pairend.py haplotype_file
WARNING: 
1. This step will generate 2 temp file for each process. It takes large portion of disk space.
2. Please do not run this in parallel unless you have huge amount of memory.

C.
haplo_count.py: combine adjacent cpgs
python haplo_count.py haplotype_file combine_num


OKRs:
1. Remodule all codes.
2. Extract common functions into utils.py(use pysam!!)
3. Perform unit test and end to end test.
4. Perform experiments:
	a. distance(certain point, random points) ~ information_entropy(random points)
	b. distance(random points, random points) ~ methylation_diff(random points, random points)
	c. develop the method to subtract the influence of same status of target CpGs.
	   For example: diff( CTC*8 , CCC*8) should be larger than diff( CTC*8, CTT*8 )
	   target CpG is the CpG in the center of the tri-bases.
	d. Introduce the influence by distance between tri-bases.
